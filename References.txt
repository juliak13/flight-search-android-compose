Flight Search App
Julia Konopka 

Used this unit codelabs for creating the files and referenece the Inventory Tracking and Bus Schedule App. Along with previous homeworks as additional references. 
 
Used Material Themes from previous homeworks and projects; Type.kt, Theme.kt, and Color.kt. (purple/pink theme)

Used ChatGPT for debugging and problems.
	Problems with dependencies and plugins. 

Had to restart the app three times due to lack of information being displayed. Application now works. 

Decided to prepopulate the flight_search.db with favorite flights.
